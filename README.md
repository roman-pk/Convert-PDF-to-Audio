# Convert-PDF-to-Audio
First version of my text to speech project which takes a pdf file, converts it to text and then to speech (mp3 file).

- I am using Tkinter to provide a simple GUI to select a file that a user would like to convert
- PdfReader to convert PDF to a text string 
- Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library to convert text to spoken mp3 file.
